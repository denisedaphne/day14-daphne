Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM)
An Agile iteration cycle starts with an iteration planning meeting where the team arranges tasks for the upcoming period. Led by the product owner, the team discusses and assigns tasks until they agree on a goal.

To achieve the meeting's goal within a set timeframe, an iteration planning meeting agenda is used. This agenda covers iteration goals, team input, and task distribution. The complete agenda includes:
•	Attendees: List of participants and their roles.
•	Capacity: Each team member's availability to determine capacity.
•	Iteration Goals: Developers and product owner detail the initial planning goal and commit to it.
•	Relevant Issues: Product owner shares important updates, and team members express concerns.
•	Story Analysis and Estimating: Team evaluates user stories, estimating time for completion. Relative sizing might be used.
•	Timebox: Meeting time limit, ideally not exceeding four hours for a two-week iteration.
•	Velocity: Calculating the team's previous iteration speed.

Agile iteration planning follows a previous iteration's conclusion and retrospective. The software team collaboratively defines the scope, estimating task durations using feedback and historical data. Before the formal iteration planning, teams estimate story values through story point estimation. The product owner prioritizes Product Backlog Items (PBIs), sets iteration goals, and defines completion criteria. The meeting involves these activities:
•	Discussing technical aspects, dependencies, and implementation for the top PBI.
•	Establishing acceptance criteria for each story.
•	Estimating effort for each story.
•	Selecting stories within the team's capacity.
•	Breaking down large stories if needed.
•	Self-assigning tasks based on skills and capacity.
•	Estimating ideal task completion hours.
•	Optionally creating an iteration backlog.
•	Adjusting tasks if someone exceeds capacity.
•	Finalizing iteration goals and committing to them.

Inputs to the iteration planning meeting consist of feedback, issues, objectives, and user stories. Outputs of the meeting include defined scope, task assignments, and agreement on goals. Capacity planning drives Agile iteration planning. The team selects high-priority items, estimates work, and commits to it. Capacity is gauged based on ideal hours, availability, and dedication percentage. More experienced teams can predict capacity better due to established velocity, while newer teams need multiple iterations to improve accuracy.
